# VRTest


Contains tests and demos of a few of my VR experiments.

Open "VRTestUnity" as a Unity project.  Go to the asset store and
manually install these two extra assets: "SteamVR" and "BaroqueUI".


## ColorPicker

A simple VR color picker, done as a single solid object to interact with.
Allows to pick either a random color from the continuous spectrum, or snapping
on some colors.
